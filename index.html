                <h2>Brief History On The Western Cape</h2>

                <p>
                    <p>
                        In 1993, the Cape Province was divided into three smaller provinces. One of them is the Western Cape. The Western Cape
                        was the first place in the country where people from Europe settled. The Europeans brought slaves from Malay to serve
                        them, and the Malay culture became part of South Africa own heritage. Some of the buildings in Cape Town are more than
                        300 years old. In the Cape, as many languages like Dutch, French, German and Malay were spoken, these were mixed to
                        form a new language called Afrikaans that is unique to South Africa. The word 'Afrikaans' means 'African' in Dutch.
                        Today, Afrikaans is the third most widely spoken home language in South Africa, after isiZulu and isiXhosa.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            Western Cape is famously known for its landmarks such as Table Mountain, Robben Island, Castle of Good Hope and their wine farms.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                Table Mountain is a national monument. It is a natrual wonder of the world that is often used as a symbol for Cape Town
                                and South Africa. On days where there are no clouds, the mountain can be seen from 200 kilometres out at sea. It is
                                called Table Mountain because it is so flat on top that it looks like a table. On the either side of Table Mountain
                                there three named hills. They are Devil's Peak, Signal Hill and Lion's Head.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Robben Island is just off the coast of Cape Town. There was a jail on the island where political prisoners were kept.
                                Political prisoners are people who are sent to jail because they challenged the government. Many leaders of the Freedom
                                Struggle were sent to Robben Island, including former President Nelson Mandela. Today, the jail is a museum and a World
                                Heritage Site because of its importance to our historical heritage.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest building in South Africa that is still standing. It was built between 1666 and
                            1679 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), a big trading company from the Netherlands. The castle has five corners,
                            like a star. Each corner has a name: Buren, Nassau, Katzenellenbogen, Leerdam and Oranje. The names come from the title
                            of the Dutch ruler of that time, the Prince of Orange. The stone that was used for the castle walls came from Robben
                            Island.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        The wines of the Western Cape are known all over the world. Groot Constantia is the oldest wine producer in the
                        country. It was part of the farm of one of the old Dutch governors of the Cape, Simon van der Stel. There are wine
                        farms, or estates, all over the province, like in the Boland, Swartland, Olifants River Valley and the Klein Karoo.

                                    Lighthouse. An entrance
                                    fee is payable and visitor numbers are controlled to avoid overcrowding. The resort is a popular
                                    destination for
                                    get-togethers on summer weekends. Braai pits and picnic tables are available. Camping and caravan sites
                                    can be hired by
                                    those wanting a longer stay.

                                    Much of the shoreline here is rocky, but there are a few sandy bays, and two large tidal pools that
                                    offer safe
                                    swimming. Crayfish divers, as well as hoop net fishers, can often be seen in the vicinity during the

                                    Tweede Tol is a Cape Nature camping and picnic site 16 kilometres from Wellington up the Bainskloof Pass, in the
                                    Limietberg Nature Reserve - a huge 102 000 hectare mountain, wildlife and fynbos reserve in the mountains.
                                </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It was built in 1851 as the original tollgate on the pass and is also known as Wolwekloof (wolf's gorge). The campsite
                                        is kept small – only 20 standard sites (another six are privately screened off) with a maximum of six allowed on each
                                        site, so it isn't surprising that it can feel rather busy – particularly over long weekends and during school holidays
                                        when daily picnic visitors arrive in a fair number (up to 120 a day).

                                <p>
                                    And what makes it so popular is the incredible scenery and the exclusive use of the Wolwekloof River swimming holes
                                    (day visitors have access to the Witte River swimming holes), and Limietberg's hiking trails (although day hikers can
                                    access these trails too if they buy a permit).
