                <h2>Brief History On The Western Cape</h2>

                <p>
                    <p>
                        In 1993, the Cape Province was divided into three smaller provinces. One of them is the Western Cape. The Western Cape
                        was the first place in the country where people from Europe settled. The Europeans brought slaves from Malay to serve
                        them, and the Malay culture became part of South Africa own heritage. Some of the buildings in Cape Town are more than
                        300 years old. In the Cape, as many languages like Dutch, French, German and Malay were spoken, these were mixed to
                        form a new language called Afrikaans that is unique to South Africa. The word 'Afrikaans' means 'African' in Dutch.
                        Today, Afrikaans is the third most widely spoken home language in South Africa, after isiZulu and isiXhosa.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            Western Cape is famously known for its landmarks such as Table Mountain, Robben Island, Castle of Good Hope and their wine farms.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                Table Mountain is a national monument. It is a natrual wonder of the world that is often used as a symbol for Cape Town
                                and South Africa. On days where there are no clouds, the mountain can be seen from 200 kilometres out at sea. It is
                                called Table Mountain because it is so flat on top that it looks like a table. On the either side of Table Mountain
                                there three named hills. They are Devil's Peak, Signal Hill and Lion's Head.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Robben Island is just off the coast of Cape Town. There was a jail on the island where political prisoners were kept.
                                Political prisoners are people who are sent to jail because they challenged the government. Many leaders of the Freedom
                                Struggle were sent to Robben Island, including former President Nelson Mandela. Today, the jail is a museum and a World
                                Heritage Site because of its importance to our historical heritage.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest building in South Africa that is still standing. It was built between 1666 and
                            1679 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), a big trading company from the Netherlands. The castle has five corners,
                            like a star. Each corner has a name: Buren, Nassau, Katzenellenbogen, Leerdam and Oranje. The names come from the title
                            of the Dutch ruler of that time, the Prince of Orange. The stone that was used for the castle walls came from Robben
                            Island.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        The wines of the Western Cape are known all over the world. Groot Constantia is the oldest wine producer in the
                        country. It was part of the farm of one of the old Dutch governors of the Cape, Simon van der Stel. There are wine
                        farms, or estates, all over the province, like in the Boland, Swartland, Olifants River Valley and the Klein Karoo.

                                    fee is payable and visitor numbers are controlled to avoid overcrowding. The resort is a popular
                                    destination for
                                    get-togethers on summer weekends. Braai pits and picnic tables are available. Camping and caravan sites

                                    Much of the shoreline here is rocky, but there are a few sandy bays, and two large tidal pools that
                                    offer safe
                                    swimming. Crayfish divers, as well as hoop net fishers, can often be seen in the vicinity during the

                                    Tweede Tol is a Cape Nature camping and picnic site 16 kilometres from Wellington up the Bainskloof Pass, in the
                                    Limietberg Nature Reserve - a huge 102 000 hectare mountain, wildlife and fynbos reserve in the mountains.
                                </p>

                                    <p>
                                        It was built in 1851 as the original tollgate on the pass and is also known as Wolwekloof (wolf's gorge). The campsite
                                        is kept small – only 20 standard sites (another six are privately screened off) with a maximum of six allowed on each
                                        site, so it isn't surprising that it can feel rather busy – particularly over long weekends and during school holidays
                                        when daily picnic visitors arrive in a fair number (up to 120 a day).

                                    And what makes it so popular is the incredible scenery and the exclusive use of the Wolwekloof River swimming holes
                                    (day visitors have access to the Witte River swimming holes), and Limietberg's hiking trails (although day hikers can
                                    access these trails too if they buy a permit).

                                    Originally known as Melkhoutskraal, the Grootvadersbosch Nature Reserve encompasses 250 hectares of indigenous
                                    forest
                                    in the Langeberg region, close to Heidelberg. The name translates to “big father” in honour of Roelof Oelofse who
                                    owned
                                    the land in 1723. It has only been a reserve since 1986 and was declared a World Heritage Site in 2004.

                                    This is the most significant stretch of indigenous afromontane forest left in the south-western Cape, with nearly all
                                    of the 35 typical forest tree species, including red alder, ironwood, stinkwood and yellowwood. Visitors to this
                                    beautiful reserve will relish the opportunity to get out into the forest on day walks and mountain biking trails. This
                                    is an excellent birding destination with more than 196 bird species regularly spotted. Hikers are likely to bump into
                                    bushbuck and spot baboons and smaller mammals when out on the trails. Sighting the forest emperor butterfly and a
                                    subspecies of the rare ghost frog would be the highlight of a visit here, as they can only be found in this particular
                                    forest.

                                <h4>Platteklip Gorge</h4>
                        
                                <p>
                                    <p>
                                        Platteklip Gorge is the oldest, quickest and easiest hiking route up Table Mountain, but also the least scenic and
                                        exciting. That doesn’t mean it’s NOT scenic and exciting – just the least compared to other routes. Also, it doesn’t
                                        mean it’s easy, just the easiest compared to other routes; it’s still strenuous. The route leads up a deep ravine,
                                        pretty along its lower sections (especially in winter, with a stream cascading) and imposing along its upper sections,
                                        where the ravine’s beetling sidewalls converge. Most people who hike Table Mountain opt for Platteklip Gorge, not
                                        because it’s such a great route, but because it’s the easiest to complete and easiest to find. While it’s more exciting
                                        than taking the cable car to the summit, it doesn’t do Table Mountain justice as far as hiking goes.

                                        The hike itself consists of big rock steps with a tiny bit of scrambling low down the route. The hiking is rather
                                        tedious, so making use of a guide adds more value in terms of learning about the mountain and for security in the event
                                        of illness or injury rather than route-finding. As Table Mountain’s oldest route – ascended in 1503 by the mountain’s
                                        first ascensionists – it carries a lot of history and lore.

                                        As a mountain-guiding company who offers hikes up all Table Mountain routes, we naturally steer people away from
                                        Platteklip Gorge and try to get them to attempt a more rewarding and scenic route. But if you’re out of shape, afraid
                                        of heights and have little interest in nature or adventure, or you’re under a time-constraint, then Platteklip Gorge is
                                        the best route for you. If you’ve never been on a mountain before, it will still leave you enraptured.

                                        Platteklip Gorge is the default descent on days when the cableway is closed due to strong wind, as it involves no
                                        technical sections or exposure to heights. The descent should not be underestimated, especially after a hike-up: the
                                        gradient is steep and the joint-jarring steps feels interminable. But despite this, it’s the easiest and safest way off
                                        Table Mountain when the cable car is not an option.

                                        Lots of local hikers snub Platteklip Gorge as a ‘easy’ hike. Beware of such sentiments. Start the route late on a hot
                                        day in summer (after 7am), and you’re not in great shape, and perhaps neglected to pack ample water (thinking it’s an
                                        ‘easy’ hike), you’re in for a very big surprise! Same goes for stormy days when dark cloud engulfs the mountain and the
                                        wind comes howling down the gorge…

                                        Maybe you don’t have the time or the energy for a hike up Table Mountain (which is roughly a 4 hour hike). But even if
                                        you do, you can’t miss hiking Table Mountain’s smaller brother – Lion’s Head.
                                    </p>

                                        There are a few reasons I say this is an essential hike. The first is that you have views in all directions: the city
                                        bowl, the Twelve Apostles, the ocean, as well as towards Table Mountain. I think it is the complete package as far as
                                        views go in Cape Town. Secondly: It is a relatively easy hike (provided you go the right way which I’ll describe
                                        below). Third: You can do it all in about 2 hours. On this day I started off around 5:30 am (to see the sunrise) and I
                                        was finished by 7:30. Fourth: you don’t necessarily need a guide. You can take a taxi or Uber to the Lion’s Head
                                        parking lot and the trail is right there. Easy.

                                        The Swellendam Hiking Trail is one of those trails that seem to have been around for ever but very few people that you
                                        speak to among the hiking community, seem to have hiked it. It is not an easy trail, especially under the extreme
                                        weather conditions that occur in the mountains, but this should not put you off as it is also a very spectacular trail
                                        and certainly one that should appear on any 'to do' of any serious hiker. The full trail is 6 days duration but there
                                        are shorter routes available ranging from single day walks to hikes of 2,3,4 and 5 days.

                                        For those who love the wild flowers of the Cape Mountain fynbos biome, the flora is some of the best examples to be
                                        found in the Cape. There are some 30 members of the erica family to be found in the area including some that are only
                                        to be found in these mountains. More than 6 members of the Protea family are also to be found along the trail.

                                        The town of Swellendam is the third oldest town in South Africa and has a rich historical past. It is worth remembering
                                        this when planning your trip so as to spend a few hours in exploring this beautiful little town.

                                <p>
                                    <p>
                                        Situated three kilometres from Muizenberg is trendy Kalk Bay, with its fishing harbour, unique village atmosphere,
                                        craft shops and its historical cottages that line the cobbled, narrow streets which snake up the mountainside towards
                                        Boyes Drive.
                                        In the 1800s the road from Muizenberg to Kalk Bay was in reasonable state, and good were transported there by ox-wagon
                                        and taken by sea to Simons’ Town. At the same time the lime kilns were developed, and the fishing industry was
                                        established.
                                        
                                        By 1795 Kalk Bay was a flourishing village. Before long, whaling was added to the many activities. This lasted until
                                        the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1883 the railway arrived in Kalk Bay, and in 1913 the much needed breakwater
                                        project started. It was completed in 1919.
                                        
                                        Kalk Bay lies between the ocean and sharply rising mountainous heights that are buttressed by crags of grey sandstone.
                                        A literal translation from the Dutch/Afrikaans name “Kalkbaai” is “Lime Bay”. Many of the surrounding caves were formed
                                        below the water table, where water chemically weakened the structure of the sandstone and streams bore the loosened
                                        grain of sand away.
                                        
                                        The railway from the central business district of Cape Town to Simon’s Town passes through Kalk Bay and in some places
                                        the line is only metres from the water’s edge.
                                        
                                        Many famous caves (with names such as ‘Ronan’s Well’, after the Walter Scott novel St. Ronan’s Well, and ‘Free Drinks
                                        Saloon’) are located in the mountains above the village. They are of importance to spaeleologists because they have
                                        formed in sandstone. Large cave systems are not often found in this type of chemically unreactive rock.
                                        
                                        Kalk Bay is also home to the famous surf spot named “Kalk Bay Reef”. This is renowned for heavy barrels and the
                                        associated shallow reef. It is best surfed on a big south-easterly swell or a north west wind. In smaller swells low
                                        tide makes for better barrels.

                                    The reserve, which was formally proclaimed in 2006, represents the last functional estuary on the False Bay coastline.
                                    As such, it functions as a fish hatchery, nursery and habitat for many animals, especially birds. Many endangered

                                        Hunting in the Western Cape is an experience unlike any other! We are extremely proud of our world class hunting area
                                        near Cape Town, in the Western Cape - the province is one of the country's most beautiful. The Western Cape is
                                        topographically and climatically varied. It has a temperate southern coastline fringed with mountains. The typical
                                        vegetation, especially in the western section, is the famed fynbos. To the north it stretches deep into the Karoo
                                        plateau.
