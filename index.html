                    In 1993, the Cape Province was divided into three smaller provinces. One of them is the Western Cape. The
                    Western Cape
                    was the first place in the country where people from Europe settled. The Europeans brought slaves from Malay
                    to serve
                    them, and the Malay culture became part of South Africa own heritage. Some of the buildings in Cape Town are
                    more than
                    300 years old. In the Cape, as many languages like Dutch, French, German and Malay were spoken, these were
                    mixed to
                    form a new language called Afrikaans that is unique to South Africa. The word 'Afrikaans' means 'African' in
                    Dutch.
                    Today, Afrikaans is the third most widely spoken home language in South Africa, after isiZulu and isiXhosa.

                    Western Cape is famously known for its landmarks such as Table Mountain, Robben Island, Castle of Good Hope
                    and their wine farms.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Table Mountain is a national monument. It is a natrual wonder of the world that is often used as a symbol
                    for Cape Town
                    and South Africa. On days where there are no clouds, the mountain can be seen from 200 kilometres out at
                    sea. It is
                    called Table Mountain because it is so flat on top that it looks like a table. On the either side of Table
                    Mountain
                    there three named hills. They are Devil's Peak, Signal Hill and Lion's Head.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Robben Island is just off the coast of Cape Town. There was a jail on the island where political prisoners
                    were kept.
                    Political prisoners are people who are sent to jail because they challenged the government. Many leaders of
                    the Freedom
                    Struggle were sent to Robben Island, including former President Nelson Mandela. Today, the jail is a museum
                    and a World
                    Heritage Site because of its importance to our historical heritage.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest building in South Africa that is still standing. It was built between
                    1666 and
                    1679 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), a big trading company from the Netherlands. The castle has five
                    corners,
                    like a star. Each corner has a name: Buren, Nassau, Katzenellenbogen, Leerdam and Oranje. The names come
                    from the title
                    of the Dutch ruler of that time, the Prince of Orange. The stone that was used for the castle walls came
                    from Robben
                    Island.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    The wines of the Western Cape are known all over the world. Groot Constantia is the oldest wine producer in
                    the
                    country. It was part of the farm of one of the old Dutch governors of the Cape, Simon van der Stel. There
                    are wine
                    farms, or estates, all over the province, like in the Boland, Swartland, Olifants River Valley and the Klein
                    Karoo.

                            Platteklip Gorge is the oldest, quickest and easiest hiking route up Table Mountain, but also the least scenic and
                            exciting. That doesn’t mean it’s NOT scenic and exciting – just the least compared to other routes. Also, it doesn’t
                            mean it’s easy, just the easiest compared to other routes; it’s still strenuous. The route leads up a deep ravine,
                            pretty along its lower sections (especially in winter, with a stream cascading) and imposing along its upper sections,
                            where the ravine’s beetling sidewalls converge.

                            Maybe you don’t have the time or the energy for a hike up Table Mountain (which is roughly a 4 hour hike). But even if
                            you do, you can’t miss hiking Table Mountain’s smaller brother – Lion’s Head. There are a few reasons I say this is an essential hike. The first is that you have views in all directions: the city bowl, the Twelve Apostles, the ocean, as well as towards Table Mountain. I think it is the complete package as far as views go in Cape Town.
